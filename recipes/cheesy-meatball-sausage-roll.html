        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place 3 <strong>small pork & beef meatballs</strong> close together in a row on each one of the <strong>20cm round wraps</strong>, in the centre one-third of the way in from the front edge.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Working one at a time, fold the front edge of the wrap over the meatballs, then fold in the sides and roll up to enclose. Spray all over with oil. Place into 1 well of the sausage roll maker seam-side down (it might not fit neatly).</li>
            <br>
            <li>Close the lid, turn on the sausage roll maker and cook for 10 minutes. Open the lid and spoon <strong>2 tbsp headted pizza sauce</strong> over the top of each sub. Sprinkle with <strong>55g (1/2 cup) grated mozzarella</strong>. Prop the lid open with the handle of a wooden spoon, to create a gap of about 2cm. Cook for a further 1-2 minutes until the cheese has melted. Season. Serve warm, scattered with <strong>basil leaves</strong>, if using.</li>
